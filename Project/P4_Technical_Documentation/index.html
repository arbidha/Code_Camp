    <header>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
    <header>Hello world</header>
    <article>
      Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed. The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
      <code>C:\Users\Your_Name>python helloworld.py
      </code> Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file. Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor. Write the below code.
      <code>print("Hello, World!")</code> Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:

      <code>C:\Users\Your_Name>python helloworld.py</code> The output should read:
      <code>Hello, World!</code> Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
    </article>

    <header>Python Syntax</header>
    <h3>Python Indentations</h3>
    <p>
      Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <code>
        if 5 > 2:
          &emsp;  print("Five is greater than two!")
      </code>
    </div>
    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>
      Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation. Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h4>Example Comments in Python:</h4>
      <code>#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")</code>
    </div>
    <h3>Docstrings</h3>
    <p>
      Python also has extended documentation capability, called docstrings. Docstrings can be one line, or multiline. Python uses triple quotes at the beginning and end of the docstring:
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h4>Example Docstrings are also comments:</h4>
      <code>"""This is a 
multiline docstring."""
print("Hello, World!")</code>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
    <header>Variables</header>
    <p>
      Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <code>x = 5
        y = "John"
        print(x)
        print(y)
      </code>
    </div>
    <p>
      Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
    </p>
        <div class="example">
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <code>x = 4 # x is of type int
        x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
        print(x)
      </code>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Names">
    <header>Variable Names</header>
    <article>
      You can declare a variable in three ways:
      <p>
       A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). 
      </p>
      <p>Rules for Python variables:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
         <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
         <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
         <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-note">
        <p>  Remember that variables are case-sensitive</p>
      </div>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Output_Variables">
    <header>Output Variables</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        The Python print statement is often used to output variables.
      </p>

      <p>
        To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <code>x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)</code>
      </div>
      <p>You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <code>x = "Python is "
            y = "awesome"
            z =  x + y
            print(z)
        </code>
      </div>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Python_list">
    <header>Python Lists</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Create a List:</p>
        <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)</code>
      </div class="example">
      <h3>Access Items</h3>
      <p>
        You access the list items by referring to the index number:
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Print the second item of the list:</p>
        <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1])</code>
      </div>
            <h3>Change Item Value</h3>
      <p>
        To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Change the second item:</p>
        <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)</code>
      </div>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
    <header>Constants</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
        syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
        identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
        can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
      </p>

      <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
      <p>
        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
      </p>

      <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
        }</code
      >
      However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
      is executed without problems.
      <code
        >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code
      >

  <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
    <header>Data types</header>
    <article>
      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li>
              null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
              is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
              other variant.
            </li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>
              Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
              unique and immutable.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
      Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
      to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
      are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
      objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
      your application can perform.

  <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
    <header>if...else statement</header>
    <article>
      Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
      true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
      is false. An if statement looks as follows:

      <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code> condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1
      is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
      <p>
        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
      </p>
      <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
      </code> In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always
      use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

      <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
      >
      It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
      because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
      the code. For example, do not use the following code:
      <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

      <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
    <header>while statement</header>
    <article>
      A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

      <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following
        while.
      </p>

      <p>
        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
      </p>

      Example:

      <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

      <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
      <p>
        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
    <header>Function declarations</header>
    <article>
      A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

      <ul>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>
          A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
        </li>
        <li>
          The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
      </p>

      <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
      <p>
        The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
      </p>
      <code>return number * number;</code>
      <p>
        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
